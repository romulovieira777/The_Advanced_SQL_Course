Section Overview


This is one of the most important sections of the course.

Analytic Functions calculate an aggregate value based on a group of rows. Unlike aggregate functions, however, Analytic Functions can return 
multiple rows for each group. We can use Analytic Functions to compute aggregated values, moving averages, running totals, percentages or 
top-N results within a group and much, much more as you will see in this section.

We will cover in detail the syntax for Analytical Functions and have a series of code alongs, practice scenarios and assignment questions.

By the end of this section you will have a solid understanding of Analytical Functions.
