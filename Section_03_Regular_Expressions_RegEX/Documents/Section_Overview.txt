Section Overview


In this section we will be focusing on Regular Expressions.

Specifically, on the metacharacters used for pattern matching in RegEx functions along with the main RegEx functions in Oracle SQL, which are:

REGEXP_LIKE

REGEXP_INSTR

REGEXP_SUBSTR

REGEXP_REPLACE

I have also included documentation for MySQL and SQL Server.
