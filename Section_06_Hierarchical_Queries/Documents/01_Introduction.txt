This section will focus on Hierarchical Queries in Oracle SQL.

You can use hierarchical queries to travel along parent-child relationships in hierarchical data.

Hierarchical data can be a table that has both a parent and child column such as family trees, product categories and
company organization structures.

In the next section I will discuss recursive CTEs which can be used as an alternate to hierarchical queries in SQL
Server and MySQL.
