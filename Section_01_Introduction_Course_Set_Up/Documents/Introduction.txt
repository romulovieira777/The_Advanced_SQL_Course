(Opcional) Instalação manual de dados


*Only read this if you had any issues downloading the sample datasets*


The datasets I am using have been refreshed as of 24th April 2021. It is possible that these datasets can be deleted or updated so that they are significantly different to my lectures.

If this is the case then I have attached the DDL Scripts and XML data files (refreshed as of 24th April 2021) in the Appendix section of this course and I have posted videos on how to manually install these datasets.

This way you can ensure that you are using the exact same dataset as per my lectures.

However, I would only suggest you manually install the data if the datasets on Oracle APEX have changed significantly.

Please visit the Appendix section if you need to manually install any of the 3 the datasets.
